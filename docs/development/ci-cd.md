# Continuous Integration and Deployment

This document outlines the CI/CD strategy and implementation for the RisingGen platform, ensuring consistent, reliable, and efficient development and deployment processes.

## Overview

RisingGen employs a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. This approach enables frequent code integration, automated quality checks, and reliable delivery to various environments.

## CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of the following stages:

```
┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│               │     │               │     │               │     │               │
│    Commit     │────►│    Build      │────►│     Test      │────►│   Analyze     │
│               │     │               │     │               │     │               │
└───────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────────┘
                                                                         │
┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐            │
│               │     │               │     │               │            │
│   Production  │◄────│    Staging    │◄────│ Development   │◄───────────┘
│               │     │               │     │               │
└───────────────┘     └───────────────┘     └───────────────┘
```

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Commit Stage**

   - Code is committed to a feature branch
   - Pre-commit hooks run linting and formatting checks
   - Branch protection rules enforce code review requirements

2. **Build Stage**

   - Source code compilation
   - Dependencies resolution and installation
   - Docker image creation (where applicable)
   - Build artifacts generation

3. **Test Stage**

   - Unit tests execution
   - Integration tests execution
   - End-to-end tests on critical paths
   - Snapshot testing for UI components

4. **Analysis Stage**

   - Static code analysis
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Code quality metrics evaluation
   - Test coverage reporting

5. **Deployment Stages**
   - Development environment deployment (automatic)
   - Staging environment deployment (manual approval)
   - Production environment deployment (manual approval with required approvals)

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

RisingGen follows a Git Flow branching strategy with the following branches:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`**: New feature development
- **`bugfix/*`**: Bug fixes
- **`release/*`**: Release preparation
- **`hotfix/*`**: Production emergency fixes

### Pull Request Process

1. Developer creates a feature branch from `develop`
2. Developer implements changes and commits to feature branch
3. Developer creates a pull request targeting `develop`
4. CI pipeline runs automatically on the pull request
5. Code review is conducted by at least one other developer
6. Pull request is merged after approvals and successful CI checks

### Code Review Guidelines

All code changes require review and must meet the following criteria:

- CI pipeline passes successfully
- Code follows established style guidelines
- Sufficient test coverage for new code
- Documentation is updated where necessary
- Security best practices are followed
- Performance considerations are addressed

## Environment Strategy

### Environment Configuration

RisingGen maintains the following environments:

| Environment | Purpose             | Update Frequency     | Access                               |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Development | Feature testing     | Continuous           | Development team                     |
| Staging     | Pre-release testing | On release readiness | Development team, QA, Product owners |
| Production  | Live system         | Scheduled releases   | End users                            |

### Configuration Management

- Environment-specific configurations are stored as environment variables
- Secrets are managed using GitHub Secrets and AWS Parameter Store
- Infrastructure configuration uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Feature flags control feature availability in different environments

## CI/CD Tools and Technologies

### Primary Tools

- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD workflow orchestration
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments
- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **ESLint/StyleLint**: Code quality enforcement
- **SonarCloud**: Code quality and security analysis

### Monitoring and Observability

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Log aggregation and monitoring
- **Datadog**: Application performance monitoring
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and reporting
- **StatusPage**: Service status communication

## Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Process

1. **Artifacts Generation**

   - Build process creates deployment artifacts
   - Artifacts are versioned and stored in artifact repository
   - Docker images are pushed to container registry

2. **Environment Preparation**

   - Infrastructure is updated if necessary
   - Database migrations are applied
   - Configuration is updated

3. **Deployment Execution**

   - Zero-downtime deployment using blue/green strategy
   - Gradual traffic shifting to new version
   - Health checks validation

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Automated smoke tests execution
   - Key metrics monitoring
   - Rollback preparation if issues detected

### Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment issues:

1. Incident is identified through monitoring or user reports
2. Decision to rollback is made by on-call engineer or team lead
3. Previous stable version is deployed using automated rollback procedure
4. Incident is documented and root cause analysis is performed

## Testing Strategy

### Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between components
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows
- **Performance Tests**: Evaluate system performance under load
- **Security Tests**: Identify security vulnerabilities

### Testing Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library**: React component testing
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing
- **k6**: Performance testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Security testing

### Test Environments

- Unit and integration tests run in CI environment
- End-to-end tests run against isolated environments
- Performance tests run against staging-like environments
- Security tests run against isolated environments with production-like data

## Security Considerations

### Secure Pipeline Practices

- Secrets are never exposed in logs or build outputs
- Dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities
- Infrastructure access follows least privilege principle
- Pipeline configurations are version controlled
- Artifact integrity is verified before deployment

### Security Scanning

The pipeline includes the following security scans:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: Analyze code for security issues
- **Container Scanning**: Check container images for vulnerabilities
- **Secret Detection**: Prevent accidental secret exposure
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Validate infrastructure configuration

## Metrics and KPIs

### Pipeline Performance Metrics

- **Build Duration**: Time taken to complete each build
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often code is deployed to production
- **Change Lead Time**: Time from commit to production
- **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing incidents
- **Mean Time To Recovery**: Time to recover from failures

### Monitoring Dashboards

- CI/CD Pipeline Performance Dashboard
- Deployment Success/Failure Dashboard
- Code Quality Trends Dashboard
- Test Coverage Dashboard

## Release Management

### Release Planning

- Releases are scheduled bi-weekly
- Release candidates are created from the `develop` branch
- Release candidates undergo additional testing in staging
- Hotfixes can be deployed outside the regular release cycle

### Release Approval Process

1. QA team verifies the release in staging environment
2. Product owner validates that requirements are met
3. Release notes are prepared documenting changes
4. Deployment schedule is communicated to stakeholders
5. Approval is granted by designated approvers

### Release Notes

Release notes include:

- New features
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Breaking changes
- Known issues
- Upgrade instructions if applicable

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- Database backups are performed daily
- Configuration backups are version controlled
- Infrastructure state is backed up
- Artifacts are retained for historical deployments

### Disaster Recovery Plan

1. **Identification**: Detect and classify the disaster
2. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
3. **Recovery**: Restore systems from backups
4. **Verification**: Ensure systems are functioning correctly
5. **Documentation**: Document the incident and response

### Recovery Time Objectives

| Component            | RTO     | RPO              |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| Database             | 1 hour  | 24 hours         |
| Application Services | 2 hours | 0 (no data loss) |
| Frontend Services    | 1 hour  | 0 (no data loss) |
