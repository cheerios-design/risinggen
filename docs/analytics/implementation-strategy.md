## Ethical Considerations

1. **Balancing Measurement and Mission**

   - Ensure metrics don't drive unintended behaviors
   - Maintain focus on spiritual goals beyond numbers
   - Consider qualitative impact alongside quantitative metrics
   - Recognize limitations of data in measuring spiritual growth

2. **Inclusive Analytics**

   - Ensure metrics represent diverse user populations
   - Avoid optimization that could marginalize minorities
   - Consider varying access levels and capabilities
   - Design for cultural differences in platform usage

3. **Transparent Purposes**
   - Clearly communicate how data is used
   - Share insights gained from analytics with users
   - Demonstrate value created through data collection
   - Be honest about limitations and assumptions

## Appendix: Example Metrics Calculations

### Active User Calculation

```
Daily Active Users (DAU) = Count of unique user IDs with at least one tracked event per day
Weekly Active Users (WAU) = Count of unique user IDs with at least one tracked event per week
Monthly Active Users (MAU) = Count of unique user IDs with at least one tracked event per month

Stickiness = DAU / MAU (higher is better)
```

### Engagement Score Calculation

```
Engagement Score = (0.4 * Content Interactions + 0.3 * Feature Usage + 0.2 * Session Duration + 0.1 * Visit Frequency) / User Benchmark

Where:
- Content Interactions = Count of content views, likes, shares, comments
- Feature Usage = Count of non-content feature interactions
- Session Duration = Average time per session in minutes
- Visit Frequency = Number of distinct days active in period
- User Benchmark = Average of all active users
```

### Event Impact Score Calculation

```
Event Impact Score = (0.3 * Attendance Rate + 0.4 * Satisfaction Score + 0.3 * Spiritual Impact)

Where:
- Attendance Rate = Actual Attendees / Registered Participants
- Satisfaction Score = Average of post-event survey scores (1-5 scale)
- Spiritual Impact = Average self-reported spiritual impact (1-5 scale)
```

### Community Connection Index

```
Connection Index = (New Connections + Active Interactions + Group Participations) / Active Users

Where:
- New Connections = New user-to-user connections formed in period
- Active Interactions = Count of meaningful user interactions (comments, messages)
- Group Participations = Count of group contributions and activities
- Active Users = Monthly active users
```

These formulas provide a starting point and should be refined based on observed platform behavior and strategic priorities.
