# RisingGen Analytics Metrics & KPIs

This document outlines the key metrics and KPIs that will be tracked and measured across the RisingGen platform.

## Mission-Aligned Metrics Framework

The RisingGen analytics approach aligns every metric with our core mission: "Draw Europe's young adults to the Savior and their covenants, enable faith-building connections with each other, facilitate conferences, broadly communicate activities, and build lifelong disciples."

Each metric falls into one of four categories that align with our four pillars:

1. **Event Success Metrics** - Measuring the effectiveness of the Unified Event Hub
2. **Community Health Metrics** - Measuring the vitality of the RisingGen Community
3. **Communication Effectiveness** - Measuring the impact of the Engagement Channel
4. **Service Impact Metrics** - Measuring the outcomes of the Impact Platform

## Metric Calculation Examples

### Event Engagement Score

The Event Engagement Score provides a holistic measure of event success beyond simple attendance:

```
Event Engagement Score = (0.3 × Attendance Rate) + (0.3 × Satisfaction Score) + (0.2 × Interaction Rate) + (0.2 × Follow-up Engagement)

Where:
- Attendance Rate = Attendees ÷ Registrations
- Satisfaction Score = Average post-event survey rating ÷ 5
- Interaction Rate = Event interactions ÷ (Attendees × Expected interactions)
- Follow-up Engagement = Users engaged in follow-up ÷ Total attendees
```

### Community Health Index

The Community Health Index measures the overall vitality of the community:

```
Community Health Index = (0.25 × Connection Rate) + (0.25 × Activity Rate) + (0.2 × Response Rate) + (0.15 × Diversity Score) + (0.15 × Retention Rate)

Where:
- Connection Rate = Avg. new connections per user per month ÷ Target connections
- Activity Rate = Active users ÷ Total users
- Response Rate = Responses received ÷ Questions/posts requiring response
- Diversity Score = 1 - (Standard deviation of regional activity ÷ Mean regional activity)
- Retention Rate = Users active this month who were also active last month ÷ Users active last month
```

### Content Effectiveness Score

Measures how well content achieves its communication goals:

```
Content Effectiveness Score = (0.3 × Reach) + (0.25 × Engagement) + (0.25 × Relevance) + (0.2 × Action Conversion)

Where:
- Reach = Content views ÷ Target audience size
- Engagement = (Likes + Comments + Shares) ÷ Views
- Relevance = Average user relevance rating ÷ 5
- Action Conversion = Users taking desired action ÷ Content views
```

### Service Impact Score

Quantifies the holistic impact of service activities:

```
Service Impact Score = (0.3 × Participation) + (0.3 × Hours Contributed) + (0.2 × People Served) + (0.2 × Reported Impact)

Where:
- Participation = Service participants ÷ Active users
- Hours Contributed = Total service hours ÷ (Active users × Target hours per user)
- People Served = Estimated people served ÷ Target impact
- Reported Impact = Average self-reported impact rating ÷ 5
```

## Best Practices for Analysis

### Data Interpretation Guidelines

1. **Look for Trends, Not Points**

   - Focus on directional changes over time
   - Establish baselines before drawing conclusions
   - Consider seasonal and cyclical factors
   - Use rolling averages for volatile metrics

2. **Consider Context**

   - Account for regional differences and needs
   - Adjust expectations based on community maturity
   - Factor in external events and influences
   - Compare similar events and activities

3. **Balance Quantitative and Qualitative**

   - Supplement metrics with user stories
   - Validate numbers with qualitative feedback
   - Use interviews to explain unexpected data
   - Remember that not everything meaningful can be measured

4. **Focus on Actionable Insights**
   - Identify specific improvement opportunities
   - Connect data to concrete next steps
   - Prioritize metrics that drive decisions
   - Create clear action plans from analysis

### Common Analysis Pitfalls

1. **Vanity Metrics Obsession**

   - Focusing on impressive numbers without meaning
   - Celebrating growth without quality
   - Tracking metrics not tied to mission objectives
   - Ignoring metrics that show challenges

2. **Correlation vs. Causation Confusion**

   - Assuming coincidental relationships are causal
   - Implementing changes based on false correlations
   - Ignoring external factors affecting metrics
   - Oversimplifying complex relationships

3. **Data Silos**

   - Analyzing metrics in isolation
   - Failing to connect data across pillars
   - Missing interdependencies between metrics
   - Not sharing insights across teams

4. **Analysis Paralysis**
   - Collecting too much data without action
   - Perfectionism preventing timely insights
   - Overcomplicating simple relationships
   - Failing to make decisions despite sufficient data

## Spiritual Metrics Considerations

### Measuring the Unmeasurable

The most important outcomes of RisingGen—spiritual growth, testimony strengthening, and covenant connection—are inherently difficult to measure quantitatively. Consider these approaches:

1. **Self-Reported Impact**

   - Regular testimony strength self-assessments
   - Specific questions about covenant commitments
   - Narrative descriptions of spiritual experiences
   - Before/after spiritual journey mapping

2. **Observable Indicators**

   - Scripture study engagement
   - Temple attendance facilitation
   - Missionary referrals
   - Leadership participation
   - Service motivation

3. **Qualitative Collection**
   - Testimony sharing spaces
   - Conversion story collection
   - Spiritual experience journals
   - Leader observations and insights

### Spiritual Privacy Balance

Respect the sacred nature of spiritual experiences while collecting meaningful data:

1. **Voluntary Sharing**

   - Always make spiritual reporting optional
   - Provide private and public sharing options
   - Allow anonymous spiritual experience sharing
   - Create safe spaces for authentic expression

2. **Appropriate Aggregation**

   - Report spiritual metrics at group levels, not individual
   - Focus on trends rather than individual experiences
   - Use range-based rather than specific metrics
   - Combine quantitative measures with anonymous stories

3. **Purpose Transparency**
   - Clearly communicate how spiritual data will be used
   - Connect data collection to mission advancement
   - Show how insights improve spiritual support
   - Demonstrate respect for sacred experiences
