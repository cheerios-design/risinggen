# Pain Point → Solution Mapping Matrix

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive mapping of every identified pain point in the RisingGen problem space to specific platform capabilities and features. Each pain point is assigned a unique code for traceability across documentation.

## Pain Point Coding System

**Format**: `[Category].[Subcategory].[Number]`

- **Category**:
  - `1.x` = Attendee pain points
  - `2.x` = Organizer pain points
  - `3.x` = Shared systemic issues

## 1. ATTENDEE PAIN POINTS ("Lost Young Adults")

### 1.1 Discovery & Awareness Barriers
