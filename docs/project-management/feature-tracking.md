### Feature Card Structure

Each feature in our tracking system includes:

- **Feature ID**: Unique identifier
- **Title**: Concise feature name
- **Description**: Brief summary
- **Priority**: Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have (MoSCoW method)
- **Size**: T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- **Status**: Current lifecycle stage
- **Epic**: Parent epic (if applicable)
- **Owner**: Product owner
- **Developer**: Assigned developer(s)
- **Related Issues**: Linked tickets
- **Dependencies**: Related features or components
- **Created**: Creation date
- **Updated**: Last update date

## Feature Prioritization

### Prioritization Framework

We prioritize features using a weighted scoring method based on:

1. **User Value** (40%): Impact on user experience and satisfaction
2. **Business Value** (30%): Revenue impact, strategic alignment
3. **Implementation Effort** (20%): Development complexity and cost
4. **Risk** (10%): Technical and organizational risk

### Priority Levels

- **P1**: Critical - Must have for launch
- **P2**: High - Important for core experience
- **P3**: Medium - Valuable but not essential
- **P4**: Low - Nice to have, future consideration

### Prioritization Process

1. Product Owner assigns initial priority
2. Team reviews and provides input
3. Stakeholders validate priorities
4. Regular reprioritization based on feedback and market changes

## Feature Tracking Tools

### JIRA Configuration

**Epic Structure**:

- Represents major feature sets
- Contains multiple user stories
- Links to specification documents

**Story Structure**:

- Linked to parent epic
- Contains detailed acceptance criteria
- Story points for estimation
- Development and QA sub-tasks

**Workflow Statuses**:

- Backlog
- Ready for Development
- In Development
- In Review
- In QA
- Ready for Release
- Released
- Closed

### GitHub Integration

- Pull requests linked to JIRA tickets
- Automated status updates via webhooks

- Technical documentation in project repository

## Reporting and Visibility

### Feature Dashboard

The product team maintains a feature dashboard that shows:

- Features by status
- Features by priority
- Development velocity
- Release timelines
- Success metrics

### Stakeholder Reporting

Regular reports include:

- **Weekly Status Updates**: Features completed, in progress, blocked

## Feature Retrospectives

After significant feature releases, we conduct a retrospective to:

1. **Review Success Metrics**: Did we achieve our goals?
2. **Analyze Process**: What worked well in our development process?
3. **Identify Improvements**: What could we do better next time?
4. **Capture Learnings**: What should we apply to future features?

## Feature Change Management

### Change Request Process

1. **Submit Change Request**: Document proposed change and justification
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess scope, timeline, and resource impact
3. **Approval Process**: Product Owner and relevant stakeholders approve
4. **Implementation Planning**: Schedule approved changes

### Scope Management

- **Small Changes**: Handled within sprint if capacity allows
- **Medium Changes**: Evaluated for current vs. future sprint
- **Large Changes**: Require replan and potentially new feature specification

## Feature Release Planning

### Release Types

- **Major Releases**: Significant feature sets (quarterly)
- **Minor Releases**: Individual features or enhancements (bi-weekly)
- **Hotfixes**: Critical bug fixes (as needed)

### Release Checklist

- Feature documentation complete
- All acceptance criteria met
- QA testing passed
- Performance testing passed
- Security review completed
- Accessibility requirements met
- Release notes prepared
- Support team briefed
