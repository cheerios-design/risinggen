# Four Pillars Presentation Framework

This document outlines the comprehensive presentation framework for the RisingGen four-pillar approach.

## Vision & Mission

### Vision Statement

Rising Gen website and app seeks to draw Europe's YA to the Savior and their covenants, to enable faith-building connections with each other, facilitate conferences, broadly communicate activities, and build lifelong disciples.

### Mission Statement

Draw Europe's young adults to the Savior and their covenants, enable faith-building connections with each other, facilitate conferences, broadly communicate activities, and build lifelong disciples.

### Comprehensive Solutions Matrix

A detailed mapping showing:

- All identified pain points
- Which pillar(s) address each pain point
- Short-term vs. long-term solutions
- Implementation priority
- Expected impact level
- Special category items that require custom approaches

## Visual Strategy

### Color Coding

Each pillar should have a consistent color throughout all presentations:

- **Unified Event Hub** - Blue (representing organization and clarity)
- **RisingGen Community** - Green (representing growth and connection)
- **Engagement Channel** - Orange (representing energy and communication)
- **Impact Platform** - Purple (representing service and spiritual growth)

### Icon System

Develop a consistent icon set for key concepts:

- Pain point icons (problem indicators)
- Feature icons (solution components)
- Transformation icons (showing change)
- Implementation icons (showing progress steps)

### Visual Templates

Create standard templates for recurring visual elements:

- Pain point clusters
- Feature diagrams
- User journey maps
- Before/after comparisons
- Implementation timelines

## Practical Recommendations

1. Start with the Executive Overview presentation to align stakeholders
2. Develop the Unified Event Hub pillar presentation first as it addresses the most immediate needs
3. Create a comprehensive visual style guide before developing detailed presentations
4. Test key slides with a small group of YSAs to ensure they resonate
5. Build a "living" presentation library where components can be updated as the project evolves
6. Include real quotes and stories from YSAs throughout Europe
7. Keep technical details in the appropriate presentations rather than trying to include everything everywhere
