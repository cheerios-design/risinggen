## Presentation Content Strategy

### For the Executive Overview:

#### Focus on transformation, not just problem-solving:

- **"From chaos to coordination"**: Event management transformation
- **"From isolation to connection"**: Community building transformation
- **"From reaction to purposeful action"**: Service impact transformation

#### Key slides should include:

1. **Vision Statement**: Rising Gen website and app seeks to draw Europe's YA to the Savior and their covenants, to enable faith-building connections with each other, facilitate conferences, broadly communicate activities, and build lifelong disciples.
2. **Mission Statement**: Draw Europe's young adults to the Savior and their covenants, enable faith-building connections with each other, facilitate conferences, broadly communicate activities, and build lifelong disciples.
3. **Pain Points Overview**: Visual representation of major challenge categories
4. **Four Pillars Introduction**: Brief description of each pillar
5. **Expected Transformation**: Visual before/after representation
6. **Call to Action**: Next steps for stakeholders

### For Pillar Deep Dives:

#### Each deck should follow this structure:

1. **Current State** (2-3 most critical pain points)

   - Real examples from YSA leaders and participants
   - Visual representation of challenges
   - Cost of inaction

2. **Pillar Solution** (theoretical capabilities)

   - Key features addressing pain points
   - How it works in practice
   - Integration with existing systems

3. **User Journey** (before/after scenario)

   - Narrative walkthrough of typical use case
   - Visual comparison of current vs. future state
   - Key touchpoints highlighting value

4. **Impact Metrics** (what success looks like)
   - Quantifiable measures of success
   - Qualitative improvements
   - Timeline for expected results

### Special Category Items:

#### Create an appendix deck for pain points that don't fit neatly into pillars:

- International compliance issues
- Specialized accessibility needs
- Legacy system integrations

## Visual Strategy Recommendations

### Executive Overview:

- **Infographics showing pain point clusters**: Visual mapping of challenges
- **Pillar icons with brief descriptions**: Consistent visual language
- **Journey maps**: Showing transformation paths

### Deep Dives:

- **Screenshots/mockups of theoretical solutions**: Visual representations of features
- **Process flow diagrams**: How the system works in practice
- **Comparison tables**: Current vs. future state metrics

## Practical Next Steps

1. Start with Event Management deep dive - it's foundational and addresses the most critical organizer-level pain points
2. Create a visual template that can be reused across all presentations
3. Build a "pain point to pillar mapping" spreadsheet as your master reference
4. Test the Executive Overview with a small audience first

## How This Structure Should Work

### Advantages:

1. **Modularity** - Present only what's relevant to specific audiences
2. **Reusability** - Each deck can evolve independently
3. **Clarity** - Focused presentations are easier to follow
4. **Flexibility** - Can combine decks for comprehensive sessions
5. **Maintainability** - Updates don't require reworking everything

### Addresses Concerns:

- **Consistency**: Shared template and visual language
- **Depth control**: Each deck can go as deep as needed without overwhelming

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1-2**: Develop Executive Overview and visual templates
2. **Week 3-4**: Create Event Management pillar deep dive
3. **Week 5-6**: Create Community & Connection pillar deep dive
4. **Week 7-8**: Create Content & Communication pillar deep dive
5. **Week 9-10**: Create Service & Impact pillar deep dive
6. **Week 11-12**: Develop technical implementation deck and solutions matrix

## Presentation Delivery Guidelines

### Presenter Preparation:

- Familiarize with all pain points and solutions before presenting
- Be prepared to provide specific examples for abstract concepts
- Practice transitioning between slides and presentations
- Have additional detail ready for Q&A sessions

### Audience Adaptation:

- For leadership: Focus on vision, impact, and resource requirements
- For technical stakeholders: Include more implementation details
- For YSA representatives: Emphasize user experience and benefits
- For organizers: Highlight practical tools and immediate benefits

### Follow-up Strategy:

- Provide access to presentation materials after sessions
- Create one-page summaries for each pillar
- Establish feedback channels for presentation improvements
- Schedule check-ins for questions that arise later
